            "SPEAKER_01 [10.6s - 12.6s]:  how to review everything.\n",
            "SPEAKER_00 [12.8s - 21.8s]:  Yeah, in other classes I've had, there's usually just one book to review, not three different books, plus all those other text excerpts and videos.\n",
            "SPEAKER_01 [22.0s - 31.5s]:  Well, developmental psychology is a little more involved compared to some other subjects. You've looked at the study guide I assume.\n",
            "SPEAKER_00 [31.9s - 40.8s]:  kind of... yes, I mean... I haven't gone through the whole thing yet. I'm still just doing the stuff on the first page.\n",
            "SPEAKER_01 [41.4s - 44.8s]:  You haven't looked at the second page of the study guide at all yet?\n",
            "SPEAKER_00 [45.4s - 50.0s]:  No, I've barely had time to go back over the first two readings from the first page.\n",
            "SPEAKER_01 [50.6s - 69.0s]:  Well, no wonder you're so confused about where to start. Let me show you a copy of the study guide. Look here. See what it says at the top of the page? This first page is just a list of all the text and videos that'll be on the test. The actual guide is on the second page. See?\n",
            "SPEAKER_00 [69.3s - 73.5s]:  Oh wow! And it says what I need to remember from each reading.\n",
            "SPEAKER_01 [74.3s - 82.9s]:  Aha! So for example, from the intro to adolescent psychology book, you only need to review the developmental stages from chapter 2.\n",
            "SPEAKER_00 [83.3s - 88.3s]:  and it looks like I need to know everything from the main textbook, the big one.\n",
            "SPEAKER_01 [88.6s - 106.6s]:  Right, you'll want to review all the core concepts in the first four chapters of development through lifespan. Well, almost all. I forgot to mention this on the study guide, but the test won't really go into Freud's stages of development. Those are a little outdated compared to newer research.\n",
            "SPEAKER_00 [107.0s - 111.4s]:  but we're still going over all of Piaget's developmental stages for children, right?\n",
            "SPEAKER_01 [111.8s - 127.3s]:  Exactly. And notice that you only need to review about half of the supplemental readings, just the ones that focus on adult psychological development, and the video on Alzheimer's disease, the brain disorder and elderly people. See, I marked it right here.\n",

            "SPEAKER_01 [137.3s - 144.9s]:  Yeah, and I actually did mention that in class. You know, you really should have checked with your classmates before coming to me.\n",

            "SPEAKER_01 [148.3s - 157.6s]:  I don't think students should be studying solo in any class. It's always better to study with a partner or a group. It can really help avoid confusion.\n",
